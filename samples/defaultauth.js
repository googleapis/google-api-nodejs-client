/**
 * The `google.auth.getClient` method creates the appropriate type of credential client for you,
 * depending upon whether the client is running in Google App Engine, Google Compute Engine, a
 * Managed VM, or on a local developer machine. This allows you to write one set of auth code that
 * will work in all cases. It most situations, it is advisable to use the getClient method rather
 * than creating your own JWT or Compute client directly.
 *
 * Note: In order to run on a local developer machine, it is necessary to download a private key
 * file to your machine, and to set a local environment variable pointing to the location of the
 * file. Create a service account using the Google Developers Console using the section APIs & Auth.
 * Select "Generate new JSON key" and download the resulting file. Once this is done, set the
 * `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to the location of the .json file.
 *
 * See also:
 * https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials
