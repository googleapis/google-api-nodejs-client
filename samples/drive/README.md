# Drive v3 API Samples

These samples allow you to list, download, and upload files from Google Drive.

## Running the samples

### **Note: Node.js version 8 or greater is required to run samples.**
Set the following values in `oauth2.keys.json` (up one directory) under the `web` key:

* `redirect_uris`
* `client_id`
* `project_id`
* `client_secret`

Your file should look like this:

```json
{
  "web" : {
    "redirect_uris": ["http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback"],
    "client_id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
    "client_secret": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>",
    "project_id": "<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>"
  }
}
```

__Run the `quickstart.js` sample:__

This sample will list the files in the user's Google Drive.

You'll need to do the following before you can run this sample:

* Enable the [Google Drive API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com/overview).
* Set the redirect API in the Google Cloud Console application registration to `http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback`.
