Clients should store these events for the lifetime of the parent recurring event. Cancelled exceptions are only guaranteed to have values for the id, recurringEventId and originalStartTime fields populated. The other fields might be empty.   - All other cancelled events represent deleted events. Clients should remove their locally synced copies. Such cancelled events will eventually disappear, so do not rely on them being available indefinitely. Deleted events are only guaranteed to have the id field populated.   On the organizer&#39;s calendar, cancelled events continue to expose event details (summary, location, etc.) so that they can be restored (undeleted). Similarly, the events to which the user was invited and that they manually removed continue to provide details. However, incremental sync requests with showDeleted set to false will not return these details. If an event changes its organizer (for example via the move operation) and the original organizer is not on the attendee list, it will leave behind a cancelled event where only the id field is guaranteed to be populated.

     * @param {string=} params.iCalUID Specifies event ID in the iCalendar format to be included in the response. Optional.
     * @param {integer=} params.maxAttendees The maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults Maximum number of events returned on one result page. The number of events in the resulting page may be less than this value, or none at all, even if there are more events matching the query.

     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Token specifying which result page to return. Optional.
     * @param {string=} params.privateExtendedProperty Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only private properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints.
     * @param {string=} params.q Free text search terms to find events that match these terms in any field, except for extended properties. Optional.
     * @param {string=} params.sharedExtendedProperty Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only shared properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints.
     * @param {boolean=} params.showDeleted Whether to include deleted events (with status equals "cancelled") in the result. Cancelled instances of recurring events (but not the underlying recurring event) will still be included if showDeleted and singleEvents are both False. If showDeleted and singleEvents are both True, only single instances of deleted events (but not the underlying recurring events) are returned. Optional. The default is False.
     * @param {boolean=} params.showHiddenInvitations Whether to include hidden invitations in the result. Optional. The default is False.
     * @param {boolean=} params.singleEvents Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves. Optional. The default is False.
     * @param {string=} params.syncToken Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All events deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted to False. There are several query parameters that cannot be specified together with nextSyncToken to ensure consistency of the client state.  These are:  - iCalUID  - orderBy  - privateExtendedProperty  - q  - sharedExtendedProperty  - timeMin  - timeMax  - updatedMin If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken. Learn more about incremental synchronization. Optional. The default is to return all entries.
     * @param {string=} params.timeMax Upper bound (exclusive) for an event's start time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by start time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, for example, 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but are ignored. If timeMin is set, timeMax must be greater than timeMin.
     * @param {string=} params.timeMin Lower bound (exclusive) for an event's end time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by end time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, for example, 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but are ignored. If timeMax is set, timeMin must be smaller than timeMax.
     * @param {string=} params.timeZone Time zone used in the response. Optional. The default is the time zone of the calendar.
     * @param {string=} params.updatedMin Lower bound for an event's last modification time (as a RFC3339 timestamp) to filter by. When specified, entries deleted since this time will always be included regardless of showDeleted. Optional. The default is not to filter by last modification time.

     * @desc Watch for changes to Events resources.
     * @alias calendar.events.watch
     * @memberOf! ()
     *
     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {boolean=} params.alwaysIncludeEmail Whether to always include a value in the email field for the organizer, creator and attendees, even if no real email is available (i.e. a generated, non-working value will be provided). The use of this option is discouraged and should only be used by clients which cannot handle the absence of an email address value in the mentioned places. Optional. The default is False.
     * @param {string} params.calendarId Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the "primary" keyword.
     * @param {string=} params.iCalUID Specifies event ID in the iCalendar format to be included in the response. Optional.
     * @param {integer=} params.maxAttendees The maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults Maximum number of events returned on one result page. The number of events in the resulting page may be less than this value, or none at all, even if there are more events matching the query. Incomplete pages can be detected by a non-empty nextPageToken field in the response. By default the value is 250 events. The page size can never be larger than 2500 events. Optional.
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy The order of the events returned in the result. Optional. The default is an unspecified, stable order.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Token specifying which result page to return. Optional.
     * @param {string=} params.privateExtendedProperty Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only private properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints.
     * @param {string=} params.q Free text search terms to find events that match these terms in any field, except for extended properties. Optional.
     * @param {string=} params.sharedExtendedProperty Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only shared properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints.
     * @param {boolean=} params.showDeleted Whether to include deleted events (with status equals "cancelled") in the result. Cancelled instances of recurring events (but not the underlying recurring event) will still be included if showDeleted and singleEvents are both False. If showDeleted and singleEvents are both True, only single instances of deleted events (but not the underlying recurring events) are returned. Optional. The default is False.
     * @param {boolean=} params.showHiddenInvitations Whether to include hidden invitations in the result. Optional. The default is False.
     * @param {boolean=} params.singleEvents Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves. Optional. The default is False.
     * @param {string=} params.syncToken Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All events deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted to False. There are several query parameters that cannot be specified together with nextSyncToken to ensure consistency of the client state.  These are:  - iCalUID  - orderBy  - privateExtendedProperty  - q  - sharedExtendedProperty  - timeMin  - timeMax  - updatedMin If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken. Learn more about incremental synchronization. Optional. The default is to return all entries.
     * @param {string=} params.timeMax Upper bound (exclusive) for an event's start time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by start time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, for example, 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but are ignored. If timeMin is set, timeMax must be greater than timeMin.
     * @param {string=} params.timeMin Lower bound (exclusive) for an event's end time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by end time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, for example, 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but are ignored. If timeMax is set, timeMin must be smaller than timeMax.
     * @param {string=} params.timeZone Time zone used in the response. Optional. The default is the time zone of the calendar.
     * @param {string=} params.updatedMin Lower bound for an event's last modification time (as a RFC3339 timestamp) to filter by. When specified, entries deleted since this time will always be included regardless of showDeleted. Optional. The default is not to filter by last modification time.
     * @param {().Channel} params.resource Request body data
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.
     * @return {object} Request object
