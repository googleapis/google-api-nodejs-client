Query expressions can be used to restrict results based upon displayName, lifecycleState and parent, where the operators `=`, `NOT`, `AND` and `OR` can be used along with the suffix wildcard symbol `*`. The displayName field in a query expression should use escaped quotes for values that include whitespace to prevent unexpected behavior. Some example queries are: * Query `displayName=Test*` returns Folder resources whose display name starts with "Test". * Query `lifecycleState=ACTIVE` returns Folder resources with `lifecycleState` set to `ACTIVE`. * Query `parent=folders/123` returns Folder resources that have `folders/123` as a parent resource. * Query `parent=folders/123 AND lifecycleState=ACTIVE` returns active Folder resources that have `folders/123` as a parent resource. * Query `displayName=\\"Test String\\"` returns Folder resources with display names that include both "Test" and "String".

     * Creates a Folder in the resource hierarchy. Returns an Operation which can be used to track the progress of the folder creation workflow. Upon success the Operation.response field will be populated with the created Folder. In order to succeed, the addition of this new Folder must not violate the Folder naming, height or fanout constraints. + The Folder's display_name must be distinct from all other Folders that share its parent. + The addition of the Folder must not cause the active Folder hierarchy to exceed a height of 10. Note, the full active + deleted Folder hierarchy is allowed to reach a height of 20; this provides additional headroom when moving folders that contain deleted folders. + The addition of the Folder must not cause the total number of Folders under its parent to exceed 300. If the operation fails due to a folder constraint violation, some errors may be returned by the CreateFolder request, with status code FAILED_PRECONDITION and an error description. Other folder constraint violations will be communicated in the Operation, with the specific PreconditionFailure returned via the details list in the Operation.error field.

     * Moves a Folder under a new resource parent. Returns an Operation which can be used to track the progress of the folder move workflow. Upon success the Operation.response field will be populated with the moved Folder. Upon failure, a FolderOperationError categorizing the failure cause will be returned - if the failure occurs synchronously then the FolderOperationError will be returned via the Status.details field and if it occurs asynchronously then the FolderOperation will be returned via the Operation.error field. In addition, the Operation.metadata field will be populated with a FolderOperation message as an aid to stateless clients. Folder moves will be rejected if they violate either the naming, height or fanout constraints described in the CreateFolder documentation.
