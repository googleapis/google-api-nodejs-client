To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] \}, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", \} \} ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 \} ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

    /**
     * Marks the Project identified by the specified `project_id` (for example, `my-project-123`) for deletion. This method will only affect the Project if it has a lifecycle state of ACTIVE. This method changes the Project's lifecycle state from ACTIVE to DELETE_REQUESTED. The deletion starts at an unspecified time, at which point the project is no longer accessible. Until the deletion completes, you can check the lifecycle state checked by retrieving the Project with GetProject, and the Project remains visible to ListProjects. However, you cannot update the project. After the deletion completes, the Project is not retrievable by the GetProject and ListProjects methods. The caller must have delete permissions for this Project.

    /**
     * Lists Projects that the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission on and satisfy the specified filter. This method returns Projects in an unspecified order. This method is eventually consistent with project mutations; this means that a newly created project may not appear in the results or recent updates to an existing project may not be reflected in the results. To retrieve the latest state of a project, use the GetProject method. NOTE: If the request filter contains a `parent.type` and `parent.id` and the caller has the `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission on the parent, the results will be drawn from an alternate index which provides more consistent results. In future versions of this API, this List method will be split into List and Search to properly capture the behavioral difference.
     * @example
     * ```js
     * // Before running the sample:
     * // - Enable the API at:
     * //   https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
     * // - Login into gcloud by running:
     * //   `$ gcloud auth application-default login`
     * // - Install the npm module by running:
     * //   `$ npm install googleapis`
     *
     * const {google} = require('googleapis');
     * const cloudresourcemanager = google.cloudresourcemanager('v1beta1');
     *
     * async function main() {
     *   const auth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
     *     // Scopes can be specified either as an array or as a single, space-delimited string.
     *     scopes: [
     *       'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',
     *       'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform.read-only',
     *     ],
     *   });

     *   const authClient = await auth.getClient();

     *   // Do the magic
     *   const res = await cloudresourcemanager.projects.list({
     *     // An expression for filtering the results of the request. Filter rules are case insensitive. If multiple fields are included in a filter query, the query will return results that match any of the fields. Some eligible fields for filtering are: + `name` + `id` + `labels.` (where *key* is the name of a label) + `parent.type` + `parent.id` Some examples of using labels as filters: | Filter | Description | |------------------|-----------------------------------------------------| | name:how* | The project's name starts with "how". | | name:Howl | The project's name is `Howl` or `howl`. | | name:HOWL | Equivalent to above. | | NAME:howl | Equivalent to above. | | labels.color:* | The project has the label `color`. | | labels.color:red | The project's label `color` has the value `red`. | | labels.color:red labels.size:big | The project's label `color` has the value `red` or its label `size` has the value `big`. | If no filter is specified, the call will return projects for which the user has the `resourcemanager.projects.get` permission. NOTE: To perform a by-parent query (eg., what projects are directly in a Folder), the caller must have the `resourcemanager.projects.list` permission on the parent and the filter must contain both a `parent.type` and a `parent.id` restriction (example: "parent.type:folder parent.id:123"). In this case an alternate search index is used which provides more consistent results. Optional.
     *     filter: 'placeholder-value',
     *     // The maximum number of Projects to return in the response. The server can return fewer Projects than requested. If unspecified, server picks an appropriate default. Optional.
     *     pageSize: 'placeholder-value',
     *     // A pagination token returned from a previous call to ListProjects that indicates from where listing should continue. Optional.
     *     pageToken: 'placeholder-value',

    /**
     * Sets the IAM access control policy for the specified Project. CAUTION: This method will replace the existing policy, and cannot be used to append additional IAM settings. NOTE: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their roles can render services completely inoperable. It is important to understand how the service account is being used before removing or updating its roles. The following constraints apply when using `setIamPolicy()`: + Project does not support `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` as `members` in a `Binding` of a `Policy`. + The owner role can be granted to a `user`, `serviceAccount`, or a group that is part of an organization. For example, group@myownpersonaldomain.com could be added as an owner to a project in the myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the examplepetstore.com organization. + Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be invited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation. + A user cannot be granted the owner role using `setIamPolicy()`. The user must be granted the owner role using the Cloud Platform Console and must explicitly accept the invitation. + Invitations to grant the owner role cannot be sent using `setIamPolicy()`; they must be sent only using the Cloud Platform Console. + Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected. + If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least one owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner from the policy will fail. This restriction also applies to legacy projects that no longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to IAM policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting owner is rectified. Authorization requires the Google IAM permission `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy` on the project
