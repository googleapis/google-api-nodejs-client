## Support status
**Note**: Google provides multiple libraries for this service. This library is in
maintenance mode, and will continue to be made available for users who have
existing applications. If you're building a new application, or modernizing a
legacy application, please use [@google-analytics/data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-analytics/data) instead.
The [@google-analytics/data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-analytics/data) library is faster, easier to use, and better maintained.
