The only valid special field is `*`, which represents any field.  Field paths may be quoted using ` (backtick). The only character that needs to be escaped within a quoted field path is the backtick character itself, escaped using a backslash. Special characters in field paths that must be quoted include: `*`, `.`, ``` (backtick), `[`, `]`, as well as any ascii symbolic characters.  Examples: (Note: Comments here are written in markdown syntax, so there is an  additional layer of backticks to represent a code block) `\`address.city\`` represents a field named `address.city`, not the map key `city` in the field `address`. `\`*\`` represents a field named `*`, not any field.  A special `Field` contains the default indexing settings for all fields.
