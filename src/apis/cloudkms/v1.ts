You use the wrapping key to encrypt (also known as wrap) the pre-existing key material to protect it during the import process. The nature of the wrapping key depends on the choice of import_method.

   * An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources.   A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.  For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).  **JSON example:**      {       &quot;bindings&quot;: [         {           &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin&quot;,           &quot;members&quot;: [             &quot;user:mike@example.com&quot;,             &quot;group:admins@example.com&quot;,             &quot;domain:google.com&quot;,             &quot;serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com&quot;           ]         },         {           &quot;role&quot;: &quot;roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer&quot;,           &quot;members&quot;: [             &quot;user:eve@example.com&quot;           ],           &quot;condition&quot;: {             &quot;title&quot;: &quot;expirable access&quot;,             &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Does not grant access after Sep 2020&quot;,             &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;request.time &lt; timestamp(&#39;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#39;)&quot;,           }         }       ],       &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;BwWWja0YfJA=&quot;,       &quot;version&quot;: 3     }  **YAML example:**      bindings:     - members:       - user:mike@example.com       - group:admins@example.com       - domain:google.com       - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com       role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin     - members:       - user:eve@example.com       role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer       condition:         title: expirable access         description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020         expression: request.time &lt; timestamp(&#39;2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z&#39;)     - etag: BwWWja0YfJA=     - version: 3  For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).
