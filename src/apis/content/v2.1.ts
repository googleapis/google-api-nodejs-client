     * Capture funds from the customer for the current order total. This method should be called after the merchant verifies that they are able and ready to start shipping the order. This method blocks until a response is received from the payment processsor. If this method succeeds, the merchant is guaranteed to receive funds for the order after shipment. If the request fails, it can be retried or the order may be cancelled. This method cannot be called after the entire order is already shipped. A rejected error code is returned when the payment service provider has declined the charge. This indicates a problem between the PSP and either the merchant's or customer's account. Sometimes this error will be resolved by the customer. We recommend retrying these errors once per day or cancelling the order with reason `failedToCaptureFunds` if the items cannot be held.

     * Deprecated. Notifies that item return and refund was handled directly by merchant outside of Google payments processing (for example, cash refund done in store). Note: We recommend calling the returnrefundlineitem method to refund in-store returns. We will issue the refund directly to the customer. This helps to prevent possible differences arising between merchant and Google transaction records. We also recommend having the point of sale system communicate with Google to ensure that customers do not receive a double refund by first refunding through Google then through an in-store return.
