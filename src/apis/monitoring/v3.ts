   * Describes how to combine multiple time series to provide a different view of the data. Aggregation of time series is done in two steps. First, each time series in the set is aligned to the same time interval boundaries, then the set of time series is optionally reduced in number.Alignment consists of applying the per_series_aligner operation to each time series after its data has been divided into regular alignment_period time intervals. This process takes all of the data points in an alignment period, applies a mathematical transformation such as averaging, minimum, maximum, delta, etc., and converts them into a single data point per period.Reduction is when the aligned and transformed time series can optionally be combined, reducing the number of time series through similar mathematical transformations. Reduction involves applying a cross_series_reducer to all the time series, optionally sorting the time series into subsets with group_by_fields, and applying the reducer to each subset.The raw time series data can contain a huge amount of information from multiple sources. Alignment and reduction transforms this mass of data into a more manageable and representative collection of data, for example &quot;the 95% latency across the average of all tasks in a cluster&quot;. This representative data can be more easily graphed and comprehended, and the individual time series data is still available for later drilldown.

However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed..If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently 1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as 12005.Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value 12.005 (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure (http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:Basic units (UNIT) bit bit By byte s second min minute h hour d dayPrefixes (PREFIX) k kilo (10^3) M mega (10^6) G giga (10^9) T tera (10^12) P peta (10^15) E exa (10^18) Z zetta (10^21) Y yotta (10^24) m milli (10^-3) u micro (10^-6) n nano (10^-9) p pico (10^-12) f femto (10^-15) a atto (10^-18) z zepto (10^-21) y yocto (10^-24) Ki kibi (2^10) Mi mebi (2^20) Gi gibi (2^30) Ti tebi (2^40) Pi pebi (2^50)GrammarThe grammar also includes these connectors: / division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples,  kBy/{email} or MiBy/10ms (although you should almost never  have /s in a metric unit; rates should always be computed at  query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). . multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For  examples, GBy.d or k{watt}.h.The grammar for a unit is as follows: Expression = Component { &quot;.&quot; Component } { &quot;/&quot; Component } ;  Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | &quot;%&quot; ) [ Annotation ]           | Annotation           | &quot;1&quot;           ;  Annotation = &quot;{&quot; NAME &quot;}&quot; ; Notes: Annotation is just a comment if it follows a UNIT. If the annotation  is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to 1. For examples,  {request}/s == 1/s, By{transmitted}/s == By/s. NAME is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not  containing { or }. 1 represents a unitary dimensionless  unit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such  as in 1/s. It is typically used when none of the basic units are  appropriate. For example, &quot;new users per day&quot; can be represented as  1/d or {new-users}/d (and a metric value 5 would mean &quot;5 new  users). Alternatively, &quot;thousands of page views per day&quot; would be  represented as 1000/d or k1/d or k{page_views}/d (and a metric  value of 5.3 would mean &quot;5300 page views per day&quot;). % represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving  a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100,  and a metric value 3 means &quot;3 percent&quot;). 10^2.% indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range  0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage  (so a metric value 0.03 means &quot;3 percent&quot;).

    /**
     * monitoring.projects.notificationChannels.getVerificationCode
     * @desc Requests a verification code for an already verified channel that can then be used in a call to VerifyNotificationChannel() on a different channel with an equivalent identity in the same or in a different project. This makes it possible to copy a channel between projects without requiring manual reverification of the channel. If the channel is not in the verified state, this method will fail (in other words, this may only be used if the SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode and VerifyNotificationChannel paths have already been used to put the given channel into the verified state).There is no guarantee that the verification codes returned by this method will be of a similar structure or form as the ones that are delivered to the channel via SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode; while VerifyNotificationChannel() will recognize both the codes delivered via SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode() and returned from GetNotificationChannelVerificationCode(), it is typically the case that the verification codes delivered via SendNotificationChannelVerificationCode() will be shorter and also have a shorter expiration (e.g. codes such as "G-123456") whereas GetVerificationCode() will typically return a much longer, websafe base 64 encoded string that has a longer expiration time.
