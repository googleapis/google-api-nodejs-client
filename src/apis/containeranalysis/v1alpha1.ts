   * An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`.

A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [ "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com", "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] \}, { "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [ "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access", "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", \} \} ], "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 \} **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') - etag: BwWWja0YfJA= - version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

     * Gets the access control policy for a note or an `Occurrence` resource. Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is a note or occurrence, respectively. Attempting to call this method on a resource without the required permission will result in a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error. Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error if the user has list permission on the project, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats: `projects/{PROJECT_ID\}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID\}` for occurrences and projects/{PROJECT_ID\}/notes/{NOTE_ID\} for notes

     * Gets the access control policy for a note or an `Occurrence` resource. Requires `containeranalysis.notes.setIamPolicy` or `containeranalysis.occurrences.setIamPolicy` permission if the resource is a note or occurrence, respectively. Attempting to call this method on a resource without the required permission will result in a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error. Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error if the user has list permission on the project, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats: `projects/{PROJECT_ID\}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID\}` for occurrences and projects/{PROJECT_ID\}/notes/{NOTE_ID\} for notes

     * Returns the permissions that a caller has on the specified note or occurrence resource. Requires list permission on the project (for example, "storage.objects.list" on the containing bucket for testing permission of an object). Attempting to call this method on a non-existent resource will result in a `NOT_FOUND` error if the user has list permission on the project, or a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error otherwise. The resource takes the following formats: `projects/{PROJECT_ID\}/occurrences/{OCCURRENCE_ID\}` for `Occurrences` and `projects/{PROJECT_ID\}/notes/{NOTE_ID\}` for `Notes`
