# serviceusage

> Enables services that service consumers want to use on Google Cloud Platform, lists the available or enabled services, or disables services that service consumers no longer use.

## Support status
**Note**: Google provides multiple libraries for this service. This library is in
maintenance mode, and will continue to be made available for users who have
existing applications. If you're building a new application, or modernizing a
legacy application, please use [@google-cloud/service-usage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/service-usage) instead.
The [@google-cloud/service-usage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google-cloud/service-usage) library is faster, easier to use, and better maintained.
