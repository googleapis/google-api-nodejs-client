  /**
   * # gRPC Transcoding  gRPC Transcoding is a feature for mapping between a gRPC method and one or more HTTP REST endpoints. It allows developers to build a single API service that supports both gRPC APIs and REST APIs. Many systems, including [Google APIs](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis), [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints), [gRPC Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway), and [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) proxy support this feature and use it for large scale production services.  `HttpRule` defines the schema of the gRPC/REST mapping. The mapping specifies how different portions of the gRPC request message are mapped to the URL path, URL query parameters, and HTTP request body. It also controls how the gRPC response message is mapped to the HTTP response body. `HttpRule` is typically specified as an `google.api.http` annotation on the gRPC method.  Each mapping specifies a URL path template and an HTTP method. The path template may refer to one or more fields in the gRPC request message, as long as each field is a non-repeated field with a primitive (non-message) type. The path template controls how fields of the request message are mapped to the URL path.  Example:      service Messaging {       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {         option (google.api.http) = {             get: &quot;/v1/{name=messages/*}&quot;         };       }     }     message GetMessageRequest {       string name = 1; // Mapped to URL path.     }     message Message {       string text = 1; // The resource content.     }  This enables an HTTP REST to gRPC mapping as below:  HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `GET /v1/messages/123456`  | `GetMessage(name: &quot;messages/123456&quot;)`  Any fields in the request message which are not bound by the path template automatically become HTTP query parameters if there is no HTTP request body. For example:      service Messaging {       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {         option (google.api.http) = {             get:&quot;/v1/messages/{message_id}&quot;         };       }     }     message GetMessageRequest {       message SubMessage {         string subfield = 1;       }       string message_id = 1; // Mapped to URL path.       int64 revision = 2;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `revision`.       SubMessage sub = 3;    // Mapped to URL query parameter `sub.subfield`.     }  This enables a HTTP JSON to RPC mapping as below:  HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `GET /v1/messages/123456?revision=2&amp;sub.subfield=foo` | `GetMessage(message_id: &quot;123456&quot; revision: 2 sub: SubMessage(subfield: &quot;foo&quot;))`  Note that fields which are mapped to URL query parameters must have a primitive type or a repeated primitive type or a non-repeated message type. In the case of a repeated type, the parameter can be repeated in the URL as `...?param=A&amp;param=B`. In the case of a message type, each field of the message is mapped to a separate parameter, such as `...?foo.a=A&amp;foo.b=B&amp;foo.c=C`.  For HTTP methods that allow a request body, the `body` field specifies the mapping. Consider a REST update method on the message resource collection:      service Messaging {       rpc UpdateMessage(UpdateMessageRequest) returns (Message) {         option (google.api.http) = {           patch: &quot;/v1/messages/{message_id}&quot;           body: &quot;message&quot;         };       }     }     message UpdateMessageRequest {       string message_id = 1; // mapped to the URL       Message message = 2;   // mapped to the body     }  The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled, where the representation of the JSON in the request body is determined by protos JSON encoding:  HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hi!&quot; }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: &quot;123456&quot; message { text: &quot;Hi!&quot; })`  The special name `*` can be used in the body mapping to define that every field not bound by the path template should be mapped to the request body.  This enables the following alternative definition of the update method:      service Messaging {       rpc UpdateMessage(Message) returns (Message) {         option (google.api.http) = {           patch: &quot;/v1/messages/{message_id}&quot;           body: &quot;*&quot;         };       }     }     message Message {       string message_id = 1;       string text = 2;     }   The following HTTP JSON to RPC mapping is enabled:  HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `PATCH /v1/messages/123456 { &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Hi!&quot; }` | `UpdateMessage(message_id: &quot;123456&quot; text: &quot;Hi!&quot;)`  Note that when using `*` in the body mapping, it is not possible to have HTTP parameters, as all fields not bound by the path end in the body. This makes this option more rarely used in practice when defining REST APIs. The common usage of `*` is in custom methods which don&#39;t use the URL at all for transferring data.  It is possible to define multiple HTTP methods for one RPC by using the `additional_bindings` option. Example:      service Messaging {       rpc GetMessage(GetMessageRequest) returns (Message) {         option (google.api.http) = {           get: &quot;/v1/messages/{message_id}&quot;           additional_bindings {             get: &quot;/v1/users/{user_id}/messages/{message_id}&quot;           }         };       }     }     message GetMessageRequest {       string message_id = 1;       string user_id = 2;     }  This enables the following two alternative HTTP JSON to RPC mappings:  HTTP | gRPC -----|----- `GET /v1/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(message_id: &quot;123456&quot;)` `GET /v1/users/me/messages/123456` | `GetMessage(user_id: &quot;me&quot; message_id: &quot;123456&quot;)`  ## Rules for HTTP mapping  1. Leaf request fields (recursive expansion nested messages in the request    message) are classified into three categories:    - Fields referred by the path template. They are passed via the URL path.    - Fields referred by the HttpRule.body. They are passed via the HTTP      request body.    - All other fields are passed via the URL query parameters, and the      parameter name is the field path in the request message. A repeated      field can be represented as multiple query parameters under the same      name.  2. If HttpRule.body is &quot;*&quot;, there is no URL query parameter, all fields     are passed via URL path and HTTP request body.  3. If HttpRule.body is omitted, there is no HTTP request body, all     fields are passed via URL path and URL query parameters.  ### Path template syntax      Template = &quot;/&quot; Segments [ Verb ] ;     Segments = Segment { &quot;/&quot; Segment } ;     Segment  = &quot;*&quot; | &quot;**&quot; | LITERAL | Variable ;     Variable = &quot;{&quot; FieldPath [ &quot;=&quot; Segments ] &quot;}&quot; ;     FieldPath = IDENT { &quot;.&quot; IDENT } ;     Verb     = &quot;:&quot; LITERAL ;  The syntax `*` matches a single URL path segment. The syntax `**` matches zero or more URL path segments, which must be the last part of the URL path except the `Verb`.  The syntax `Variable` matches part of the URL path as specified by its template. A variable template must not contain other variables. If a variable matches a single path segment, its template may be omitted, e.g. `{var}` is equivalent to `{var=*}`.  The syntax `LITERAL` matches literal text in the URL path. If the `LITERAL` contains any reserved character, such characters should be percent-encoded before the matching.  If a variable contains exactly one path segment, such as `&quot;{var}&quot;` or `&quot;{var=*}&quot;`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client side, all characters except `[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The server side does the reverse decoding. Such variables show up in the [Discovery Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as `{var}`.  If a variable contains multiple path segments, such as `&quot;{var=foo/*}&quot;` or `&quot;{var=**}&quot;`, when such a variable is expanded into a URL path on the client side, all characters except `[-_.~/0-9a-zA-Z]` are percent-encoded. The server side does the reverse decoding, except &quot;%2F&quot; and &quot;%2f&quot; are left unchanged. Such variables show up in the [Discovery Document](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis) as `{+var}`.  ## Using gRPC API Service Configuration  gRPC API Service Configuration (service config) is a configuration language for configuring a gRPC service to become a user-facing product. The service config is simply the YAML representation of the `google.api.Service` proto message.  As an alternative to annotating your proto file, you can configure gRPC transcoding in your service config YAML files. You do this by specifying a `HttpRule` that maps the gRPC method to a REST endpoint, achieving the same effect as the proto annotation. This can be particularly useful if you have a proto that is reused in multiple services. Note that any transcoding specified in the service config will override any matching transcoding configuration in the proto.  Example:      http:       rules:         # Selects a gRPC method and applies HttpRule to it.         - selector: example.v1.Messaging.GetMessage           get: /v1/messages/{message_id}/{sub.subfield}  ## Special notes  When gRPC Transcoding is used to map a gRPC to JSON REST endpoints, the proto to JSON conversion must follow the [proto3 specification](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json).  While the single segment variable follows the semantics of [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) Section 3.2.2 Simple String Expansion, the multi segment variable **does not** follow RFC 6570 Section 3.2.3 Reserved Expansion. The reason is that the Reserved Expansion does not expand special characters like `?` and `#`, which would lead to invalid URLs. As the result, gRPC Transcoding uses a custom encoding for multi segment variables.  The path variables **must not** refer to any repeated or mapped field, because client libraries are not capable of handling such variable expansion.  The path variables **must not** capture the leading &quot;/&quot; character. The reason is that the most common use case &quot;{var}&quot; does not capture the leading &quot;/&quot; character. For consistency, all path variables must share the same behavior.  Repeated message fields must not be mapped to URL query parameters, because no client library can support such complicated mapping.  If an API needs to use a JSON array for request or response body, it can map the request or response body to a repeated field. However, some gRPC Transcoding implementations may not support this feature.

     * The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the `value_type` is `INT64`, `DOUBLE`, or `DISTRIBUTION`.

Different systems may scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of `0.02KBy` _might_ be displayed as `20By`, and a value of `3523KBy` _might_ be displayed as `3.5MBy`). However, if the `unit` is `KBy`, then the value of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed..  If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an `INT64 CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is `s{CPU}` (or equivalently `1s{CPU}` or just `s`). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as `12005`.  Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you can create a `DOUBLE CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is `ks{CPU}`, and then write the value `12.005` (which is `12005/1000`), or use `Kis{CPU}` and write `11.723` (which is `12005/1024`).  The supported units are a subset of [The Unified Code for Units of Measure](http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html) standard:  **Basic units (UNIT)**  * `bit`   bit * `By`    byte * `s`     second * `min`   minute * `h`     hour * `d`     day * `1`     dimensionless  **Prefixes (PREFIX)**  * `k`     kilo    (10^3) * `M`     mega    (10^6) * `G`     giga    (10^9) * `T`     tera    (10^12) * `P`     peta    (10^15) * `E`     exa     (10^18) * `Z`     zetta   (10^21) * `Y`     yotta   (10^24)  * `m`     milli   (10^-3) * `u`     micro   (10^-6) * `n`     nano    (10^-9) * `p`     pico    (10^-12) * `f`     femto   (10^-15) * `a`     atto    (10^-18) * `z`     zepto   (10^-21) * `y`     yocto   (10^-24)  * `Ki`    kibi    (2^10) * `Mi`    mebi    (2^20) * `Gi`    gibi    (2^30) * `Ti`    tebi    (2^40) * `Pi`    pebi    (2^50)  **Grammar**  The grammar also includes these connectors:  * `/`    division or ratio (as an infix operator). For examples,          `kBy/{email}` or `MiBy/10ms` (although you should almost never          have `/s` in a metric `unit`; rates should always be computed at          query time from the underlying cumulative or delta value). * `.`    multiplication or composition (as an infix operator). For          examples, `GBy.d` or `k{watt}.h`.  The grammar for a unit is as follows:      Expression = Component { &quot;.&quot; Component } { &quot;/&quot; Component } ;      Component = ( [ PREFIX ] UNIT | &quot;%&quot; ) [ Annotation ]               | Annotation               | &quot;1&quot;               ;      Annotation = &quot;{&quot; NAME &quot;}&quot; ;  Notes:  * `Annotation` is just a comment if it follows a `UNIT`. If the annotation    is used alone, then the unit is equivalent to `1`. For examples,    `{request}/s == 1/s`, `By{transmitted}/s == By/s`. * `NAME` is a sequence of non-blank printable ASCII characters not    containing `{` or `}`. * `1` represents a unitary [dimensionless    unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1, such    as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units are    appropriate. For example, &quot;new users per day&quot; can be represented as    `1/d` or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean &quot;5 new    users). Alternatively, &quot;thousands of page views per day&quot; would be    represented as `1000/d` or `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a metric    value of `5.3` would mean &quot;5300 page views per day&quot;). * `%` represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and annotates values giving    a percentage (so the metric values are typically in the range of 0..100,    and a metric value `3` means &quot;3 percent&quot;). * `10^2.%` indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range    0..1, that will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage    (so a metric value `0.03` means &quot;3 percent&quot;).

Any version prefix will be replaced by the   version of the including interface plus the root path if   specified.  Example of a simple mixin:      package google.acl.v1;     service AccessControl {       // Get the underlying ACL object.       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {         option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl&quot;;       }     }      package google.storage.v2;     service Storage {       //       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl);        // Get a data record.       rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns (Data) {         option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v2/{resource=**}&quot;;       }     }  Example of a mixin configuration:      apis:     - name: google.storage.v2.Storage       mixins:       - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl  The mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are also declared with same name and request/response types in `Storage`. A documentation generator or annotation processor will see the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method after inherting documentation and annotations as follows:      service Storage {       // Get the underlying ACL object.       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {         option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v2/{resource=**}:getAcl&quot;;       }       ...     }  Note how the version in the path pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`.  If the `root` field in the mixin is specified, it should be a relative path under which inherited HTTP paths are placed. Example:      apis:     - name: google.storage.v2.Storage       mixins:       - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl         root: acls  This implies the following inherited HTTP annotation:      service Storage {       // Get the underlying ACL object.       rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {         option (google.api.http).get = &quot;/v2/acls/{resource=**}:getAcl&quot;;       }       ...     }

    /**
     * servicenetworking.operations.list
     * @desc Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.  NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/x/operations`. To override the binding, API services can add a binding such as `"/v1/{name=users/x}/operations"` to their service configuration. For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.
