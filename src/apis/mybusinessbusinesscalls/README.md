# mybusinessbusinesscalls

> The My Business Business Calls API manages business calls information of a location on Google and collect insights like the number of missed calls to their location. Additional information about Business calls can be found at https://support.google.com/business/answer/9688285?p=call_history. If the Google Business Profile links to a Google Ads account and call history is turned on, calls that last longer than a specific time, and that can be attributed to an ad interaction, will show in the linked Google Ads account under the &quot;Calls from Ads&quot; conversion. If smart bidding and call conversions are used in the optimization strategy, there could be a change in ad spend. Learn more about smart bidding &lt;https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7065882&gt;. To view and perform actions on a location&#39;s calls, you need to be a `OWNER`, `CO_OWNER` or `MANAGER` of the location. Note - If you have a quota of 0 after enabling the API, please request &lt;https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/prereqs#request-access&gt; for GBP API access.
