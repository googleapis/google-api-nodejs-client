The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).

Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.zone Name of the zone for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.zone The name of the zone for this request.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.
     * @return {object} Request object

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region scoping this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.zone The name of the zone where the managed instance group is located.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * * // BEFORE RUNNING:
     * // ---------------
     * // 1. If not already done, enable the Compute Engine API
     * //    and check the quota for your project at
     * //    https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/compute

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.zone The name of the zone where the instance group is located.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {string} params.instanceGroup The name of the instance group from which you want to generate a list of included instances.
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.zone The name of the zone where the instance group is located.
     * @param {().InstanceGroupsListInstancesRequest} params.resource Request body data
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.

For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.
     * @return {object} Request object

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.
     * @return {object} Request object

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.zone The name of the zone for this request.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region scoping this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.
     * @return {object} Request object

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region scoping this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region for this request.

     * @memberOf! ()
     *
     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region scoping this request.

     * compute.regionInstanceGroupManagers.recreateInstances
     * @desc Schedules a group action to recreate the specified instances in the
     * managed instance group. The instances are deleted and recreated using the
     * current instance template for the managed instance group. This operation
     * is marked as DONE when the action is scheduled even if the instances have
     * not yet been recreated. You must separately verify the status of the
     * recreating action with the listmanagedinstances method.  If the group is
     * part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can
     * take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed
     * before the VM instance is removed or deleted.  You can specify a maximum
     * of 1000 instances with this method per request.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region scoping this request.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region for this request.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region scoping this request.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.
     * @return {object} Request object

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.zone Name of the zone scoping this request.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region scoping this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.
     * @return {object} Request object

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.region Name of the region for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.

     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {string} params.zone Name of the zone for request.

     * @param {object} params Parameters for request
     * @param {string=} params.filter A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be either =, !=, >, or <.  For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance.  You can also filter nested fields. For example, you could specify scheduling.automaticRestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart = true) (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake"). By default, each expression is an AND expression. However, you can include AND and OR expressions explicitly. For example, (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart = true).
     * @param {integer=} params.maxResults The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
     * @param {string=} params.orderBy Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     * @param {string=} params.pageToken Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     * @param {string} params.project Project ID for this request.
     * @param {object} [options] Optionally override request options, such as `url`, `method`, and `encoding`.
     * @param {callback} callback The callback that handles the response.
     * @return {object} Request object
