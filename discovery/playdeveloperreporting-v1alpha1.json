For filtering basics, please check [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160). ** Supported field names:** * `apiLevel`: Matches error issues that occurred in the requested Android versions (specified as the numeric API level) only. Example: `apiLevel = 28 OR apiLevel = 29`. * `versionCode`: Matches error issues that occurred in the requested app version codes only. Example: `versionCode = 123 OR versionCode = 456`. * `deviceModel`: Matches error issues that occurred in the requested devices. Example: `deviceModel = \"walleye\" OR deviceModel = \"marlin\"`. * `deviceType`: Matches error issues that occurred in the requested device types. Example: `deviceType = \"PHONE\"`. * `errorIssueType`: Matches error issues of the requested types only. Valid candidates: `CRASH`, `ANR`. Example: `errorIssueType = CRASH OR errorIssueType = ANR`. ** Supported operators:** * Comparison operators: The only supported comparison operator is equality. The filtered field must appear on the left hand side of the comparison. * Logical Operators: Logical operators `AND` and `OR` can be used to build complex filters following a conjunctive normal form (CNF), i.e., conjunctions of disjunctions. The `OR` operator takes precedence over `AND` so the use of parenthesis is not necessary when building CNF. The `OR` operator is only supported to build disjunctions that apply to the same field, e.g., `versionCode = 123 OR errorIssueType = ANR` is not a valid filter. ** Examples ** Some valid filtering expressions: * `versionCode = 123 AND errorIssueType = ANR` * `versionCode = 123 AND errorIssueType = OR errorIssueType = CRASH` * `versionCode = 123 AND (errorIssueType = OR errorIssueType = CRASH)`",

For filtering basics, please check [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160). ** Supported field names:** * `apiLevel`: Matches error reports that occurred in the requested Android versions (specified as the numeric API level) only. Example: `apiLevel = 28 OR apiLevel = 29`. * `versionCode`: Matches error reports that occurred in the requested app version codes only. Example: `versionCode = 123 OR versionCode = 456`. * `deviceModel`: Matches error reports that occurred in the requested devices. Example: `deviceModel = \"walleye\" OR deviceModel = \"marlin\"`. * `deviceType`: Matches error reports that occurred in the requested device types. Example: `deviceType = \"PHONE\"`. * `errorIssueType`: Matches error reports of the requested types only. Valid candidates: `JAVA_CRASH`, `NATIVE_CRASH`, `ANR`. Example: `errorIssueType = JAVA_CRASH OR errorIssueType = NATIVE_CRASH`. * `errorIssueId`: Matches error reports belonging to the requested error issue ids only. Example: `errorIssueId = 1234 OR errorIssueId = 4567`. ** Supported operators:** * Comparison operators: The only supported comparison operator is equality. The filtered field must appear on the left hand side of the comparison. * Logical Operators: Logical operators `AND` and `OR` can be used to build complex filters following a conjunctive normal form (CNF), i.e., conjunctions of disjunctions. The `OR` operator takes precedence over `AND` so the use of parenthesis is not necessary when building CNF. The `OR` operator is only supported to build disjunctions that apply to the same field, e.g., `versionCode = 123 OR versionCode = ANR`. The filter expression `versionCode = 123 OR errorIssueType = ANR` is not valid. ** Examples ** Some valid filtering expressions: * `versionCode = 123 AND errorIssueType = ANR` * `versionCode = 123 AND errorIssueType = OR errorIssueType = CRASH` * `versionCode = 123 AND (errorIssueType = OR errorIssueType = CRASH)`",

Multiple contiguous datapoints in a timeline outside of the expected range will be grouped into a single anomaly. Therefore, an anomaly represents effectively a segment of a metric's timeline. The information stored in the `timeline_spec`, `dimensions` and `metric` can be used to fetch a full timeline with extended ragne for context. **Required permissions**: to access this resource, the calling user needs the _View app information (read-only)_ permission for the app.",

This metric set contains AlarmManager wakeup counts data combined with process state data to produce a normalized metric independent of user counts. **Supported aggregation periods:** * DAILY: metrics are aggregated in calendar date intervals. Due to historical constraints, the only supported timezone is `America/Los_Angeles`. **Supported metrics:** * `excessiveWakeupRate` (`google.type.Decimal`): Percentage of distinct users in the aggregation period that had more than 10 wakeups per hour. If your app exhibits an excessive wakeup rate equal to or higher than the threshold, it's in the bottom 25% of the top 1,000 apps on Google Play (by number of installs). * `excessiveWakeupRate7dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `excessiveWakeupRate` in the last 7 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. * `excessiveWakeupRate28dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `excessiveWakeupRate` in the last 28 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. * `distinctUsers` (`google.type.Decimal`): Count of distinct users in the aggregation period that were used as normalization value for the `excessiveWakeupRate` metric. A user is counted in this metric if they app was doing any work on the device, i.e., not just active foreground usage but also background work.

The string representation consists of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`) or `-` (`U+002D`), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits (\"the integer\"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -> `2.5`). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -> `0.5`). - Coercing the exponent character to lower-case (`2.5E8` -> `2.5e8`). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5e0` -> `2.5`). Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5e-1` <-> `0.25`). Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a service does support them, values **must** be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = '+' | '-'; Significand = Digits '.' | [Digits] '.' Digits; Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits; Digits = { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' }; Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and **should** round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service **may** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if precision would be lost. Services **should** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if the service receives a value outside of the supported range.",
